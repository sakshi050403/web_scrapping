Web Scraping with Selenium and BeautifulSoup

Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. By combining Selenium and BeautifulSoup, you can effectively scrape and parse web data.

Selenium: A browser automation tool that allows you to programmatically interact with websites. It simulates user actions like clicking, scrolling, and form submissions, making it ideal for scraping dynamic content that relies on JavaScript.

BeautifulSoup: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It helps in extracting and navigating the HTML content once it is fetched, allowing you to easily find and manipulate the data you need.

Process Overview:

Set Up Selenium: Launch a browser instance and navigate to the target webpage.
Extract HTML: Use Selenium to interact with the page and retrieve the HTML content.
Parse HTML with BeautifulSoup: Feed the HTML content to BeautifulSoup for parsing and extraction.
Data Extraction: Use BeautifulSoupâ€™s methods to locate and extract specific elements or data.
